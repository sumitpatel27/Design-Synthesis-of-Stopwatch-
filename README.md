# Design-Synthesis-of-Stopwatch-
Primary function of this stopwatch is to use internal clock and using counter create stopwatch watch, which can be start and pause by key button, between the one second it should also show 1/100 part of second, all the digits including 1/100 of second should be display on seven segment display board. Secondary function is to provide two types of mode, Lap Mode, and Split Mode, in lap mode, using the key button it should hold the time till button is pressed again, that’s how lap time would be noted down in the background main stopwatch should be running as it is. In split time mode, when one presses the button it should start count from zero temporarily and count until again button press, so it will show basically the timing required to reach from one point to another. After counting and pressing the split time button, it will display the split timing for 6 second, meanwhile stopwatch should be running as it is and after 6 second it should continue showing original stopwatch timing again. While any stopwatch operation two inputs are provided to show student id immediately without disturbing stopwatch operation. Reset button to set whole stopwatch to set in default condition. The algorithm and programming files developed in Quartus-II software, simulated in ModelSim®, and implemented in an ALTERA DE0-CV board.
